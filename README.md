Hi!

I'm an experienced Senior Technical Support Engineer and Workgroup Manager working at Nokia and specializing mainly in Packet Core & EPC technologies. 

I'm primarily working with python and bash scripting in my everyday job for automation and for fun as well.
My popular framework is Django and I usually deploy my Django projects with Docker compose or Kubernetes.
